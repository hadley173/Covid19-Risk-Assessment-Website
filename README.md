.gitignore currently assumes that if you're working in a virtual environment locally, you've named it "venv"

## First-time setup
1. `git clone <repo link>`
2. `cd <cloned repo>`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `flask run`
